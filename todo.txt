make winning modal fade in
redecorate everything
    : error when guessing player
        : border of text goes red / shakes
        : resets
    : on winning modal, option to view shortest path after winning
    : display graphs should be resizeable for phones
    : add an example for the info buttons ?
    : add a reset button which gets rid of the path but keeps the players
    : group all nodes to connected teams (NOT SURE IF THIS WILL LOOK WORSE)
        : have teams be a node and players link to it
