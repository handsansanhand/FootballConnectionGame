make winning modal fade in
redecorate everything
    : clicking show winning/best path puts the player id in the input
    : winning modal is ok for phones ?
    : fix the gold winning path display
    : display graphs should be resizeable for phones
    : add an example for the info buttons ?
    : result messages fade in + out after a delay
    : group all nodes to connected teams (NOT SURE IF THIS WILL LOOK WORSE)
        : have teams be a node and players link to it
